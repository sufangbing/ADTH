By running main.m, the specific enhancement results of neuron fiber structure and the localization and filling results of 
neuron cell body can be obtained.



eig3volume.m is a function that computes encapsulated eigenvalues.



Hessian3DDifferenceAutoSize.m for encapsulation of hazen matrix adaptive window size calculation function.



FrangiFilter3DAutoWindowSize.m to encapsulate the fibrous structure of neuron specific enhancement function.
